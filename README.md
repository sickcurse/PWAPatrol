# PWAPatrol

This project is a browser-based text editor built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The app is a single-page application (SPA) that follows PWA best practices, providing data persistence through multiple techniques to ensure offline functionality and redundancy. Users can continue working with the text editor even when they lose internet access.
